# BattleTech Helper Scripts
---
## What this is supposed to help with?
I created this repo because I like playing Battletech and I wanted to write some python scripts to help with playing the tabletop game.

## GUI Programs
- Box Of Doom: Python GUI which offers Dialog options and outputs the results of rolls in an Easy to Read format

## CLI Programs
- Box Of Doom: CLI which rolls X number of dice in the Command Line. The first program I wrote for this.
